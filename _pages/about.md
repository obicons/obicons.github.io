I am a fifth year PhD candidate in The Ohio State University's CSE department, where I help developers understand challenges faced by emerging technology & I create tools to help developers build reliable software systems. Currently, I study reliability challenges in autonomous vehicle firmware. My advisors are Drs. Feng Qin and Christopher Stewart.
