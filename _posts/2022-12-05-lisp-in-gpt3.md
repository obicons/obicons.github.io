TL;DR: ChatGPT is a LISP REPL.

Inspired by a [recent post](https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/) where the author used ChatGPT as a virtual machine, I wanted to learn if [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) can be a useful LISP interpreter. To my surprise, ChatGPT understands LISP remarkably well.


## LISP Basics

Figure 1 shows the initial prompt I used. It's very similar to the prompt in *Building A Virtual Machine inside ChatGPT*. We see a few interesting facts already:
* ChatGPT understands that `NIL` evaluates to `NIL`.
* ChatGPT understands function application (at least, for arithmetic functions).
* ChatGPT understands some subtle semantics of Common Lisp: i.e., `(eq (car nil) nil)`.

## CONS and SETF

|Figure 2: `CONS`'ing and `SETF`s.|

In LISP, we construct a `CONS` cell that contains two pointers (called `CAR` and `CDR`) with the `CONS` function. Continuing on to Figure 2, it seems like ChatGPT is aware of how `CONS` works. LISP also allows us to modify the value stored in a place with the the `SETF` macro. If the first argument to the `SETF` macro is a symbol (e.g., `my-list`), then `SETF` modifies the symbol table to associate the symbol-name with the value of the 2nd argument. ChatGPT seems aware of how `SETF` behaves. The first line of Figure 3 shows that ChatGPT can remember the state of the symbol table.

## A Function Named `F`
Figure 3 shows the definition of a function named `f`. Here, `f` computes the factorial of a number. This might seem challenging, since `f` is a recursive function. But ChatGPT evaluates the function without any problems. Figure 4 shows `f` applied to a larger, challenging input. Once again, ChatGPT correctly evaluates the expression.

## The Persistence of Memory
Let's see if ChatGPT still recalls the association between `my-list` and `(42)` we introduced in our symbol table. Figure 4 shows the results of evaluating `(setf (car my-list) 42)`. We see that:
* ChatGPT understands `setf` works on arbitrary places, not just symbol names.
* ChatGPT remembers we associated `my-list` with a list containing a single element.

## Y-Combinator

Let's try another challenge: The Y Combinator. I used [this implementation](https://gist.github.com/nitin-motiani/2379663). Figure 5 shows the results.

To my surprise, ChatGPT understands the function definition and correctly evaluates it. This is particularly challenging, since it shows:
* ChatGPT knows about `FUNCALL` and understands what it means to be a LISP-2.
* ChatGPT follows the indirection in the function calls.

## Closing Thoughts
I am very surprised how well ChatGPT handles the task of interpreting LISP code. I am very curious if ChatGPT actually *understands* the source code, or if it has seen enough examples that it can blindly regurgitate results it has memorized. Since LISP has very simple semantics, it's a great tool for studying the extent of a large language model's ability to understand and interpret source code. 

At this past year's ASE, there was a really interesting paper called [*AST-Probe: Recovering abstract syntax trees from hidden representations of pre-trained language models*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.11719.pdf). One conclusion of this paper is large language models deeply understand syntax trees. I wonder if we can somehow decide if large language models understand a language's operational semantics?
